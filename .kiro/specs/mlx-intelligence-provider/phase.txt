I've organized the tasks into 8 logical phases for incremental development:

Phase 1: Python MLX Sidecar (Foundation)

Task 1: Build the Python sidecar with NDJSON protocol and all 7 commands
Phase 2: Model Management (LlmModelManager)

Task 2: Create the Rust model manager for catalog, downloads, and lifecycle
Phase 3: MlxProvider Implementation

Task 3: Implement the MlxProvider with IntelProvider trait, content chunking, and model switching
Phase 4: Provider Selection & Settings

Tasks 4-5: Provider fallback chain and IntelligenceSettings integration
Phase 5: Backend Commands & Checkpoint

Tasks 6-7: Tauri commands for model management, backend testing checkpoint
Phase 6: Frontend UI

Task 8: Settings UI with model list, download progress, and controls
Phase 7: Error Handling & Robustness

Task 9: Graceful degradation, error handling, and property tests
Phase 8: Integration Testing & Final Validation

Tasks 10-11: End-to-end testing and final checkpoint
This phased approach allows you to build and test incrementally, with each phase producing a working artifact before moving to the next.
