Done! I've organized the tasks into 6 logical phases:

Phase 1: Foundation - Data models and database schema (no dependencies)

Phase 2: Backend Infrastructure - Python sidecar and Rust provider implementation (depends on Phase 1 for data structures)

Phase 3: Integration - Gem enrichment flow and settings (depends on Phase 2 for working backend)

Phase 4: User Interface - Settings page and gem detail view (depends on Phase 3 for working integration)

Phase 5: Testing & Validation - Unit tests, property-based tests, and integration tests (depends on Phases 1-4 for complete implementation)

Phase 6: Documentation & Polish - README, code docs, and testing guide (depends on Phase 5 to validate everything works)

Each phase has clear goals, dependencies, and groups related tasks together for efficient implementation.
